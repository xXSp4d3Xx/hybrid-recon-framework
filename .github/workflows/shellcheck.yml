Add GitHub Actions workflow to run ShellCheck on shell scripts.

- Runs on push to main and branches matching cleanup/**
- Installs shellcheck and runs it against tracked .sh files
- Helps catch common shell issues early in CI

Notes:
- Workflow file: .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
- Run shellcheck locally with: shellcheck scripts/*.sh
